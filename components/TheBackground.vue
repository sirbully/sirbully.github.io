        I'm currently training to get AWS-certified in many areas. I've recently
        achieved the foundational AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and now
        moving on to the AWS Solutions Architect certification.

        I'm a part-time IT and English teacher for students in Japan where I
        help them learn English from a technical environment. Our lessons range
        from the foundations of web design to deployment of full-scale web
        applications using modern technology. I also recently started
        freelancing as a full-stack developer at Changing Digital, a UK-based
        software development agency. I work with other developers to create
        websites for SMEs and large enterprises. Our stack includes React,
        Redux, Next.js, React Native, Github Actions, and AWS.

        As a software engineer, my goal is to always keep learning in order for
        me to be able to create the most efficient and scalable applications
        possible. I make it my mission to continue growing and be a better
        person than I was yesterday.
      </p>

        <strong>When I'm not coding</strong>, I'm most likely learning a new
        language (programming or spoken!), hunting for freelancing gigs or
        listening to my books on Audible.
